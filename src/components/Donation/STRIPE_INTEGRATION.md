# Stripe Integration for Donation System

This document outlines the implementation of Stripe payment processing for the donation system.

## Current Implementation

The Stripe integration is currently implemented with a feature flag approach:

- Feature flag: `enable-stripe` (add as URL parameter)
- Test mode only: No actual payments are processed
- Simulated backend API for payment intent creation

## How to Test

1. Visit the donation page with the feature flag: `/donate?enable-stripe`
2. Select the Credit/Debit Card payment option
3. Choose an amount or enter a custom amount
4. Enter test card details:
   - Success card: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
   - Decline card: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
   - Authentication required: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
   - Use any future date for expiry and any 3 digits for CVC

## Next Steps for Production Implementation

1. **Backend API Setup**:
   - Create a secure backend API endpoint for creating payment intents
   - Implement webhook handling for payment events
   - Set up proper error handling and logging

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Create separate test and production Stripe API keys
   - Use environment variables for API key management
   - Never expose secret keys in frontend code

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Implement recurring donations
   - Add Apple Pay and Google Pay support
   - Consider implementing Stripe Checkout for a hosted payment page option

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure PCI compliance
   - Implement proper CORS configuration
   - Set up fraud prevention measures

5. **User Experience**:
   - Add proper loading states
   - Improve error messaging
   - Implement receipt emails

6. **Go Live Checklist**:
   - Remove feature flag
   - Switch to production API keys
   - Perform thorough testing
   - Monitor initial transactions
